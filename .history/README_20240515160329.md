# repo-95-reactjs-basics
here im explaining the basics of react in thw own way

# reactjs basics
* react is an front-end library , if u open a website , the page u seeing is called frontend 
* it was used to build single page application
* it was maintained by facebook

## advantages:
* less traffic
* user internet consuming will be less

# Basics:
1. Components    
- **i.e  part of page or some specific conetent , we can divide the components in anyway posible , we can simply same , if u click on the component , total website doesnt rerender , only component will rerender**

2. Props
- **i.e take an component , if u want to send data from outside to component called props
- for reusablity we use props
- 
3. State 
- **i.e if u want to create a data inside the component , and manipulate , and want to show them called state
- we use this state for SPA (single page application things)

* prop and state both are data
- prop will come from outside
- state it will only inside the component

## Components are 2 types 
1. class based component (we will create javascript class and we wil render componenets)
2. function based component (we will create functions and we will render them)
