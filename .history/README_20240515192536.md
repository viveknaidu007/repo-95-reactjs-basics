# repo-95-reactjs-basics
here im explaining the basics of react in my own way

# reactjs basics
* react is an front-end library , if u open a website , the page u seeing is called frontend 
* it was used to build single page application
* it was maintained by facebook

## advantages:
* less traffic
* user internet consuming will be less

# Basics:
1. Components    
- **i.e  part of page or some specific conetent , we can divide the components in anyway posible , we can simply same , if u click on the component , total website doesnt rerender , only component will rerender**

2. Props
- **i.e take an component , if u want to send data from outside to component called props
- for reusablity we use props
- 
3. State 
- **i.e if u want to create a data inside the component , and manipulate , and want to show them called state
- we use this state for SPA (single page application things)

* prop and state both are data
- prop will come from outside
- state it will only inside the component

## Components are 2 types 
1. class based component (we will create javascript class and we wil render componenets)
* inside the classes , there will be state inbuilt

2. function based component (we will create functions and we will render them)
* inside the clases , there is no inbuilt state , so we use hooks concept , then we will achive state
* hooks are special type of functions
* note: basically react community found that , many developers are using the functions , so in functions we dont have state , so they created hooks , and hooks also a function

## steps to install react.js
* type "node js" in google
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
* download only LTS (long term support) while downloading for better
* donwload and install (click on addtopath while installing)
* in cmd type node it will show wheather it was installed ot not

## vscode
* create a folder and 
* npx create-react-app react-basics in your terminal


- while running above command in cmd ,  if u get this belowerror:
- C:\Users\poppo\Desktop\github ai\end to end by vivek\repo-95-reactjs-basics>npx create-react-app react-basics
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall lstat
npm ERR! path C:\Users\poppo\AppData\Roaming\npm
npm ERR! errno -4058
npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat 'C:\Users\poppo\AppData\Roaming\npm'
npm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to fi
npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:**

* if u facing above error : u can try 2 methods

1. ## first method: 
* npm install -g npm@latest
- This will reinstall npm globally on your system

2. ## second method:

- Check Environment Variables (if the above solution doesn't work):
        Search for "environment variables" in your system settings.
        Ensure that the PATH variable includes the directory where npm is installed. Typically, it's something like C:\Program Files\nodejs. You can add the path if it's missing.**


# now install extention in vscode
* ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets

- whats the use of this extention?
* if we want to create CBC (class based component) , we dont need to workhard .
* just "rcc" is enough for class based
* if we want to add constructor just "rcont" (reactconstrucotr)

* just "rfc" is enough for function based

# basically we do , create components and load them that's it
## to start the react:
* cd react-basics 
* npm start

# we can also do our react.js experiments in:
* https://playcode.io/react

## ok now what is jsx?
- JSX is an eligible / compatible html format 
- JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React
- import React from 'react';

## some points:
- in html forms we have for, but in jsx forms wehave for loop 

export function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <h1>Hello React.</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

// Log to console
console.log('Hello console')**

## we can use below website for html to JAX 
- https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx
