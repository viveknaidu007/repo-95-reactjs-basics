# repo-95-reactjs-basics
here im explaining the basics of react in thw own way

# reactjs basics
* react is an front-end library , if u open a website , the page u seeing is called frontend 
* it was used to build single page application
* it was maintained by facebook

## advantages:
* less traffic
* user internet consuming will be less

# Basics:
1. Components    
- **i.e  part of page or some specific conetent , we can divide the components in anyway posible , we can simply same , if u click on the component , total website doesnt rerender , only component will rerender**

2. Props
- **i.e take an component , if u want to send data from outside to component called props
- for reusablity we use props
- 
3. State 
- **i.e if u want to create a data inside the component , and manipulate , and want to show them called state
- we use this state for SPA (single page application things)

* prop and state both are data
- prop will come from outside
- state it will only inside the component

## Components are 2 types 
1. class based component (we will create javascript class and we wil render componenets)
* inside the classes , there will be state inbuilt

2. function based component (we will create functions and we will render them)
* inside the clases , there is no inbuilt state , so we use hooks concept , then we will achive state
* hooks are special type of functions
* note: basically react community found that , many developers are using the functions , so in functions we dont have state , so they created hooks , and hooks also a function

## steps to install react.js
* type "node js" in google
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
* download only LTS (long term support) while downloading for better
* donwload and install (click on addtopath while installing)
* in cmd type node it will show wheather it was installed ot not
